# 🔒 CURSED — MILESTONE 1 (M1)
## Runtime Engine Structure

This document defines the exact scope, behavior, and constraints of Milestone 1.

Anything not explicitly included here is **out of scope** for M1.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Establish a stable, deterministic runtime engine foundation that future milestones can safely build upon.

M1 is about **structure**, not gameplay richness.

---

## ✅ INCLUDED IN M1

- Run lifecycle state model
- Persistent run_state.json with atomic writes and backups
- Restart safety (RUNNING → PAUSED on load)
- Runtime objective models:
    - ObjectiveDefinition
    - ObjectiveSlot
    - TeamObjectiveState
- JSON-safe persistence layer
- Objective data loading & validation
- `/curse status` trimmed to spec
- Debug command scaffolding (gated)

---

## ❌ EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM M1

- Curse effects
- Scoring or outcomes
- UI/HUD work
- Randomized logic
- Player punishment/reward mechanics
- Balance tuning
- Content expansion

If it’s not listed in INCLUDED, it does not belong in M1.

---

## 🧱 Implementation Rules

- No speculative systems
- No placeholders for future behavior
- No “just in case” logic
- All state transitions must be explicit
- All persistence must be verifiable

---

## 📌 Completion Criteria
M1 is considered complete when:
- All included systems are implemented
- State survives restart safely
- No TODOs remain inside M1 scope
- The engine can be used as a foundation without refactors
